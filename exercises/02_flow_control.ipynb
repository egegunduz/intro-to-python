    "\n",
    "A very popular example for a problem solved by recursion are the [Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). In its basic version, a \"tower\" consisting of, for example, four disks with increasing radii, is placed on the left-most of three adjacent spots (in the following, we refer to the number of disks as $n$, so here $n=4$). The task is to move the entire tower to the right-most spot whereby two rules must be obeyed:\n",
    "1. disks can only be moved individually, and\n",
    "2. a disk with a larger radius must *not* be placed on a disk with a smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Towers of Hanoi are a *classic* example (already introduced by mathematician [Ã‰douard Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Lucas) in 1883), it is still actively researched as this [article](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793830919300017?journalCode=dmaa&) published in January 2019 shows.\n",

    "In the following, you will convert the mathematical notation from the video into Python code. Since a lot can go wrong and most likely the first couple of tries will end in *semantic* errors (i.e., the code runs but produces an infeasible set of moves), it is advisable to have some sort of visualization of the progam's flow of execution. Therefore, it is recommended to use some online version of the game (like the one on [mathsisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)) and try out the solutions your implementations create. Besides feasible solutions, we are, of course, also interested in the solutions with the minimal number of steps needed to move a tower from one spot to another."

When \"passed\" into the $Sol(\\cdot)$ function they take on the role of an origin ($o$) and destination ($d$) pair. So, the expression $Sol(4, 1, 3)$ would be the same as $Sol(4, \\text{\"left\"}, \\text{\"right\"})$ and refers to the problem of moving a tower consisting of $4$ disks from origin $1$ / \"left\" to destination $3$ / \"right\".

    "Let's look at how we can achieve the opposite and pass a value on in a \"forwards\" fashion. This might seem somewhat \"weird\" to do but there is quite a useful case for doing it. The above implementation of `hanoi()` prints the optimal solution's moves in the correct order but fails to put an order number to it. This can be build in by passing on one more argument `offset` down the recursion tree as we will see shortly."

To calculate the `count` number in the first function call, we need to determine the number that is right in the middle of the overal number of steps. For example, for $n=3$, we know that `count` must be $4$ because the total number of moves in the optimal solution is $7$. This is just the difference of the number of solutions for $n=3$, $7$, and $n=2$, $3$. Complete the code with the correct expressions for `total`, `half`, and `count` according to the stated observation."

However, for large $n$ it is more practical to calculate the order number \"on the fly\" by passing information down the recursion tree."
