    "Loose *communities* are the main building block around which open-source software is built. Someone starts a project (like Guido) and makes it free to use for anybody (e.g., on a platform like [GitHub](https://github.com/)). People find it useful enough to solve one of their daily problems and start using it. They see how a project could be improved and provide new use cases (via the popularized concept of a \"[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)\"). The project grows both in lines of code and number of people using it. After a while, people start local user groups to share their same interests and meet on a regular basis (e.g., this is a big market for companies like [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) or non-profits like [PyData](https://pydata.org/)). Out of these local and usually monthly meetups grow yearly conferences on the country or even continental level (e.g., the original [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/) in the US, [EuroPython](https://europython.eu/), or [PyCon.DE](https://de.pycon.org/)). The content presented at these conferences is made publicly available via GitHub and YouTube (e.g., [PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ) or [EuroPython](http://europython.tv/)) and serves as references on what people are working on and introductions to the endless number of specialized fields."

It means reading through parts of documentation, blogs with best practices, and tutorials, or researching some problem on Stack Overflow while trying to implement some feature in the application at hand. Also, it means using command line tools to automate some part of the work, or manage different versions of a software simultaneously using software like **[git](https://git-scm.com/)**. In short, programming involves a lot of \"muscle memory\". This can only be built and kept up through near-daily usage.\n",
